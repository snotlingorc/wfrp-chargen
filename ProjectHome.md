## History ##
Started in 2005 and written in java, this generator was a to be the next evolution to a pc generator written for the web (in php - See link on the side bar).  With a couple months of development, the project was shelved.  Now, the start of March 2009, the project has arisen again.  Instead of using flat text files, XML was chosen as the back-end source for races and careers.
