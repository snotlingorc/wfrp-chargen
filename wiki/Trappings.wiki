Please use this page to discuses trappings and how they will work in the generator


= Details =

Currently, in the xml files, trappings are listed with:
{{{
  <Trappings>Light Armour (Leather Jack)</Trappings>
  <Trappings>One set of Good Craftsmanship Clothes</Trappings>
  <Trappings>2d10 leaflets for various causes</Trappings>
}}}

While this is fine for the first run, it would be nice to be able to handle things differently.  Something like:
{{{
<Trappings type= "Armour">Light Armour (Leather Jack)</Trappings>
}}}
or
{{{
<Trappings type="Currency">2d6 Gold Crowns</Trappings>
}}}

What other ways do you think this could be done, and what all categories should their be?

  * Currency
  * Armour
  * Melee Weapon
  * Missile Weapon
  * Specialist  Weapon
  * General Equipment
  * Special Equipment
